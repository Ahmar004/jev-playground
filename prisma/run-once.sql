-- Run-once SQL: whatever is below runs ONCE per database, on the next deploy.
--
-- Write the SQL for a one-off change here (fix a value, insert reference rows,
-- backfill a column, replace a view), test it with `pnpm db:run-once` against a
-- local database, open the PR, merge. Production applies it once, right after
-- the migrations, and records it in the "_run_once_sql" table so it never runs
-- again. Next time, REPLACE the content below with the new one-off — don't
-- append to the old one, it already ran.
--
-- How "once" works: the runner hashes the executable content (comments and
-- whitespace don't count, so a doc tweak never re-runs anything) and skips any
-- version already in the ledger. The ledger row and your SQL are written in the
-- same transaction: both land or neither does, so a failed run is retried on
-- the next deploy and a successful one cannot repeat.
--
-- Rules:
--   - Data and objects only: UPDATE / INSERT / DELETE, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW,
--     CREATE EXTENSION, GRANT. Tables, columns, indexes and enums still go in
--     prisma/schema/*.prisma — the drift check after this file fails on them.
--   - CI applies this file to an EMPTY database first, so matching nothing must
--     be fine (an UPDATE ... WHERE that finds no rows), and an INSERT that needs
--     rows only production has must be guarded (INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE EXISTS).
--   - Everything runs inside one transaction: no CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, no VACUUM.
--   - Merge conflict in this file? Keep only your SQL. The other side already ran.
--
-- Full policy: docs/rules/migrations.md, "Run-once SQL".

-- ROADMAP Step-35: users who already have level progress know the app, so the
-- first-visit guide (welcome tour and level tips) counts as seen for them.
-- Only new users, and users who replay it, see the guide.
